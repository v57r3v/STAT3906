4. For an insurance coverage,claim sizes follow   a   distribution which   is   a   mixture   of   a   uniform. distribution on   [0,10]with weight 0.5 and a uniform   distribution   on   [5,1   3]   with   weight   0.5.For   a   policy   with   a   policy   limit   of   a,the   expected   payment   is   6.11875.Find the value   of a.
